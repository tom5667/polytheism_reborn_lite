 pr.044.desc.muslim:1 "The Christians' dominion over Constantinople has finally come to an end. \n\nThanks to the committed efforts of many devoted servants of [scoped_destroyer.GetFaith.HighGodName], all of Greece has fallen under [scoped_destroyer.GetFaith.GetAdjective] rule. The faithful have worked tirelessly to strip away all blasphemous icons and bring the decadent clergy that ruled over these lands to justice."
 pr.044.desc.hellenic:1 "The tyranny of the Galileans over Europe has finally come to an end.\n\nFor centuries these glorified cultists have been given free rein to vilify and deface the ancient monuments of our divine protectors, but no more! By restoring [scoped_destroyer.GetFaith.GetAdjective] rule over Constantinope and the Greek lands, we have squashed the very heart of the Church of the carpenter god."
 pr.044.desc.fallback:0 "After centuries being belittled and deceived by their missionaries, the followers of [scoped_destroyer.GetFaith.HighGodName] have finally taken their revenge upon the followers of the Christ god. \n\nThe heartland of their faith has been conquered with the favor of our gods, their churches have been pillaged, their priests stripped of all power and dignity. Thanks to my glorious invasion, I have rid the world of this cowardly religion and avenged the dishonor brought upon our lands and ancestors by their trickery."
