pr_illyrian.001.desc:0 "You are sitting in your chambers, nursing your wounds from a recent battle. You are in great pain, and you know that you will not heal on your own.\nSuddenly, a knock comes at the door. You open the door to find a priest of Tadenus, the Illyrian god of healing."Greetings," the priest says."I have heard of your wounds, and I have come to offer my help."\n\nYou are hesitant at first, but you agree to let the priest heal you. He places his hands on your wounds and chants a prayer to Tadenus.\nHe then sacrifices a small animal and offers its flesh to the flames.\n\n As the priest prays, you feel a warm tingling sensation in your wounds. The pain begins to subside. After a few minutes, the priest finishes his prayer. He smiles and says, "Tadenus has heard our prayers."\n\nYou are grateful to the priest, and you know that Tadenus has watched over you.\nHowever, you know that not all wounds heal, and that even the gods cannot always save us. You will have to wait and see if Tadenus's blessing is enough to heal you."

pr_illyrian.003.desc:0 " You are asleep in your bed when you have a dream. In your dream, you are standing on a battlefield. The ground is stained with blood, and the air is filled with the sound of battle.\n\nSuddenly, you see a figure riding towards you on a white horse. It is Medaurus, the Illyrian god of war. Medaurus is tall and imposing, and he carries a lance in his hand.\n\nMedaurus stops in front of you and raises his lance. "I have come to you," he says, "because you have been chosen to be a champion of the Illyrian faith."\n\nYou are shocked. "Me?" you ask. "But I am just a simple person."\n\n"You are not so simple," Medaurus says. "You have a strong heart and a brave spirit. These are the qualities that a champion needs."\n\nMedaurus lowers his lance. "I bless you with my strength and courage," he says. "You will be a great leader and a powerful warrior. You will bring glory to the Illyrian faith."Medaurus disappears, and you wake up.\nYou sit up in bed, your heart pounding. Was it just a dream? Or did Medaurus really appear to you?"

#Embrace Dacian culture 
pr_illyrian.005.t:0 "Illyrian"
pr_illyrian.005.desc:0 "For too long, we have lost the old virtues of the Illyrian tribes. The last king who revolted against the Romans, Bardylis, was a true Illyrian. He was brave, strong, and wise. He fought for the freedom of our people, and he died a hero's death. But after his death, our people were scattered and divided. We lost our culture and our language. We became slaves to the Romans. But now, it is time to reclaim our heritage. It is time to become Illyrians again."
