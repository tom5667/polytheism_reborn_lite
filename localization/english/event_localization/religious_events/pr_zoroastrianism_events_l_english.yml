With the Arabian invaders vanquished, their lands and temples reclaimed, a collective sense of relief sweeps across the land, a glimmer of optimism piercing the darkness. Amongst the aristocracy and priesthood, a fervent desire ignites to restore the Avesta, their sacred text, ravaged by the invaders. This ancient repository of divine wisdom, painstakingly compiled over centuries, holds immense significance, its loss a grievous blow to the Zoroastrian faith. Your head of faith [religious_head.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], recognizing the gravity of this task and its profound symbolism, addresses the congregation with unwavering conviction. "Fellow Mazdayasna," he declares with his voice resonating through the grand hall, "as we stand on the threshold of a new era, we must not let the sacred text that guided our ancestors slip into oblivion. The Avesta, our beacon of wisdom, has been scattered and destroyed by the invaders. Now, it is time to restore what had once been lost!""
